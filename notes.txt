SQL from Ed's email dated 3/16/15 11:57 am - see other emails from this day
for more notes on what they're currently doing too. SALIX uses basic
frequency in a lookup table to guess.

See sql below. Lichen and bryophyte databases definitely has OCR data.

SELECT IFNULL(i.originalurl, i.url) as url, r.rawstr, o.*
FROM images i inner join specprocessorrawlabels r ON i.imgid = r.imgid
INNER JOIN omoccurrences o ON i.occid = o.occid;

Unprocessed specimens:

SELECT IFNULL(i.originalurl, i.url) as url, r.rawstr, o.*
FROM images i inner join specprocessorrawlabels r ON i.imgid = r.imgid
INNER JOIN omoccurrences o ON i.occid = o.occid
WHERE o.processingstatus = "unprocessed";

Processed specimens:

SELECT IFNULL(i.originalurl, i.url) as url, r.rawstr, o.*
FROM images i inner join specprocessorrawlabels r ON i.imgid = r.imgid
INNER JOIN omoccurrences o ON i.occid = o.occid
WHERE o.processingstatus IS NULL OR o.processingstatus != "unprocessed";
